				<h4><id="homeAnnOne"></id>Now accepting Board of Directors applications</id></h4>
				<h6>10/24/17</h6>
				<hr/>
				<p>If you are interested in running for a seat on the PF HOA Board of Directors, you can download an  application form 
				<a href="https://www.prairiefieldshoa.com/uploads/2/2/9/1/22916178/pf-hoa-2018-bod-nomination.pdf">here.</a></p>
				<br/>
				<p>The day to day operations of the PF HOA are run by an all-volunteer Board of Directors, along with help 
				from many other committee volunteers.  The Board establishes the annual dues assessment and is 
				responsible for using the money assessed to maintain and improve HOA property and offer programs which 
				are of value to Prairie Fields residents, thereby increasing the value of the neighborhood.  If you have 1-2 
				hours a month to donate to the neighborhood, you are encouraged to run one of the 3 upcoming vacancies 
				on the Board for a term which begins January 1, 2018 and runs through December 31, 2019.  Applications 
				must be submitted by November 10. </p>
				<br/>
				<p>This year, voting will be conducted electronically.  You can opt for paper ballots by dropping a note in the 
				HOA dropbox.  Homeowners must be a member in good standing to vote in the election, and not owe the association 
				more than $10.   You can access the <a href="https://www.prairiefieldshoa.com/store/c1/Featured_Products.html">
				past dues list by clicking here.</a></p>

				When: Sunday, December 18th 5:30PM to 7:30PM </p>
				<br/>
				<p>Planning<br/>
				We will be planning at the next HOA Board meeting at Carrie Busey Elementary on Monday, November 14th 
				at 8pm. If you'd like to help out in any capacity of the planning please attend. </p>
				<br/>
				<p>Treat Tables - If you'd like to host, please e-mail: board@prairiefieldshoa.com <br/><br/>
				We will be looking for folks to provide and monitor the treat tables/voting stations. Each table will be given 
				$30 to purchase the treats. We would like to focus on having these tables stationed at corners throughout 
				the neighborhood to make it easy for visitors to find. This year we are looking to have ballot style voting
				sheets that people can carry with them as they look at the houses. </p>
				</br>
				<p>PRIZES!<br/>
				As was the case last year, there will be trophies for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Place as well as honorable mention 
				ribbons. We will also have a fun prize for one random participating house!</p>
