	<h4>The Committees</h4>
	<p>The Prairie Fields HOA has a number of committees to assist in exploring issues, running an annual election,
		 hosting neighborhood events, and more.  Click on the name of each committee below for more information, or 
		 send an email to board@prairiefields.org to volunteer on a committee.</p>
	<h4>Architectural Control Committee</h4>
	<p>The goal of the Architectural Control Committee is to preserve the property values of all homeowners in Prairie 
		Fields, and to ensure compliance with applicable covenants when a homeowner makes changes to their property.  
		The <a href="covenants.html">Covenants</a> for each phase of Prairie Fields specify that certain changes to your property require the approval 
		of the Architectural Control Committee.  This committee of residents within Prairie Fields will review proposed 
		plans and grant approval to proceed.  For now, this includes items like an addition to your home, building a deck, 
		fence, or shed, or other substantial work which might affect your neighbors.</p>
		<p>Homeowners are required to submit plans for fences, decks, sheds or other outbuildings, additions, and other structures which require architectural 
		approval to the architectural control committee.  You may wish to review your <a href="covenants.html">Covenants</a> for your particular home, before contacting the ACC.</p>
		<p>Please supply the following information to the ACC by email - ACC@prairiefieldshoa.com:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Your name and house address</li>
			<li>Your email address</li>
			<li>A description of the work that you plan to do</li>
			<li>A PDF drawing of the plans</li>

	<h4>Election Committee</h4>
